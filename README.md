# SoundNicer
Eurorack Sound Nicer Module:

Maximizes the sonic potention of your modular signals.
Simple input and output with process and contour knobs.
Based off the CoolAudio V2153M

Version 1.1 Changes:
Rotate power header
Changed resistor values to prevent clipping of incoming audio
Changed the potentiometer values and series resistors. Anything past 2'oclock starts to add distortion to the band.
